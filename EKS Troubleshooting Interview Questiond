4. Your EKS cluster has a high number of pod evictions, and some workloads are frequently getting evicted and rescheduled across nodes. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
5. One of your EKS pods is repeatedly getting OOMKilled (Out of Memory Killed). How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
6. One of your EKS pods is stuck in a CrashLoopBackOff state. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
7. When a pod fails to resolve an external or internal domain, DNS resolution issues might be the root cause. Here's how to systematically debug and fix the problem.
8. You notice that one of your pods in Amazon EKS is stuck in the ContainerCreating state for an extended period. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
